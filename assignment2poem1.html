      <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
      <span id="author">By: Robert Frost</span>
      <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
            <br>His house is in the village though;
            <br>He will not see me stopping here
            <br>To watch his woods fill up with snow.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          <p>My little horse must think it queer
            <br>To stop without a farmhouse near
            <br>Between the woods and frozen lake
            <br>The darkest evening of the year.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          <p>He gives his harness bells a shake
            <br>To ask if there is some mistake.
            <br>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
            <br>Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
            <br>But I have promises to keep,
            <br>And miles to go before I sleep,
            <br>And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
