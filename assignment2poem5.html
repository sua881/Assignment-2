      <h1>STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING</h1>
      <h2><span id="by">By</span> Robert Frost</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
          <br>His house is in the village though;
          <br>He will not see me stopping here
          <br>To watch his woods fill up with snow.
        </p>

        <p>My little horse must think it queer
          <br>To stop without a farmhouse near
          <br>Between the woods and frozen lake
          <br>The darkest evening of the year.
        </p>

        <p>He gives his harness bells a shake
          <br>To ask if there is some mistake.
          <br>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
          <br>Of easy wind and downy flake.
        </p>

        <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
          <br>But I have promises to keep,
          <br>And miles to go before I sleep,
          <br>And miles to go before I sleep.
        </p>
