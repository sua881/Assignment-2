    <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
    <span id="author">by: Robert Frost</span>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
      <br>His house is in the village though;
      <br>He will not see me stopping here
      <br>To watch his woods fill up with snow.
    </p>

      <p>My little horse must think it queer
        <br>To stop without a farmhouse near
        <br>Between the woods and frozen lake
        <br>The darkest evening of the year.
      </p>

      <p>He gives his harness bells a shake
        <br>To ask if there is some mistake.
        <br>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
        <br>Of easy wind and downy flake.
      </p>

      <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
        <br>But I have promises to keep,
        <br>And miles to go before I sleep,
        <br>And miles to go before I sleep.
      </p>
