          <p>
            Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
<br>
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
<br>
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
<br>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
